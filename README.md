# Arcana Machine Learning Toolkit

Arcana Toolkit is a simple library developed  by myself in my free-time to learn how works some machine learning models and how to implement them. I also try to make some personnel stuff as "custom" machine learning algorithm.  I try  to use  as few libraries as possible to keep this easy-readable and comprehensive that vanilla python code provide.

###  Installation

------

You can simply install the library using ``pip`` command :

```bash
pip install arcana-ml
```

You also can clone the repository and install requirements to modify them as you want . Be careful to respect the ``LISCENCE``  associated with the project.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lumaes/Arcana-ml-toolkit/
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Contributing

------

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change. Please make sure to update tests as appropriate. Just try the keep as readable and clean code as possible and avoid to use too much libraries.

### Helpful tutorials

------

I am going to list here all the tutorials I followed to build this library in order to give credit to the person concerned.
